# RNA-Seq Data Normalization

This repository contains resources and information about data normalization in RNA-Seq data analysis.

## What is Data Normalization?

Data normalization is a crucial step in RNA-Seq data analysis to remove biases and make samples comparable. It adjusts for differences in sequencing depth and gene length, among other factors.

## Normalization Methods

There are several methods for normalizing RNA-Seq data, including:

- Reads Per Kilobase Million (RPKM)
- Transcripts Per Million (TPM)
- Fragments Per Kilobase Million (FPKM)
- Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM)
- etc.

## How to Normalize RNA-Seq Data

The normalization process typically involves the following steps:

1. Calculate raw read counts or expression values.
2. Apply the normalization method of choice.
3. Check the distribution of normalized data.
4. Perform downstream analysis using the normalized data.
